--Overview of the Dataset

SELECT *
FROM  dbo.Housing

--Standardizing Date Format : The field "SaleDate" includes the Date and time of the sale but on close observation we notice that the time of sale is not present
--in our data. So the purpose of upcoming query is to change the format of this field from Date-Time to Date.

SELECT SaleDate

--Populating Property Address date : The PropertyAddress field appears to be filled with many null values. We cannot generally populate these cells but in our case, we
--see that addresses of some Parcel ID's are not null which means that we can populate the null values in the PropertyAddress field with those addresses which have the 
--same Parcel ID as the null values.

SELECT *

--Splitting the Address columns into multiple columns (Address, City, State): The field PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress contains the address, city and state which needs to be split in 2 and 3
--separate columns respectively.
