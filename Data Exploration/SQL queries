--Overview of the Datasets

SELECT *

WHERE Continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,4

ORDER BY 3,4


--Selection of data that is useful for analysis

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE Continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2


--Total Cases vs Total Deaths
--Shows the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country

SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE location like '%india%'
AND Continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2



--Total Cases vs Population
--Shows what percentage of population got covid

SELECT location, date, Population, total_cases, (total_cases/Population)*100 as PercentagePopulationInfected
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
AND Continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2



--Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to the population

SELECT location, Population, MAX(total_cases) As HighestInfectionCount, MAX(total_cases/Population)*100 as PercentagePopulationInfected
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY Location, Population
ORDER BY PercentagePopulationInfected DESC



--Looking at countries with Highest Death Count per Population

SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths As int)) As TotalDeathCount
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null                  
GROUP BY Location, Population
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
--The data has some rows where the continent is null and the continent is allocated to the location column. So we use "is not null" command to deal with this problem.



--BREAKING THINGS DOWN BY CONTINENT

--Continents with Highest Death Count per Population

-- Grand total cases and deaths

SELECT SUM(new_cases) As TotalCases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths as int)) As TotalDeaths
